Project Idea - Euro Trip
=========================

A lot of people every year go for backpacking europe from India, I want to create a handy app that could provide them curated infromation about the best places they should visit when they are in Europe and a breif descirption on what they can expect from that place.
This also includes information regarding the type of VISA they would need in order to tour europe. the currency conversion piece will help them in doing their financial calculation upfront. 

Current Scope
=============

In the currennt scope the app showcase five countries and their 5 most popular tourist destination. 
The currency conversion piece uses the currency exchange unit as of 26 May 2016..


Future Scope
===============

The app can be upgraded to show a bunch of information about each and every country present in europe
The currency conversion can include all the other currency other that Euro that's workable in Europe

The following are the few upgrades I have in my mind :-
1. Adding a social piece to the app, so that you can connect with fellow backpacker
2. A forum which could help you locate all the stuff that you might need in your trip and where you can found those, for instance visa application, currency exchnage booths, indian embassy in euro counties.
3. A map piece with popular destination already pinned that could help backpacker, also a travelling algorithm that will help backpacker to conver more area in less time.
